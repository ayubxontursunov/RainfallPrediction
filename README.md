# Final Project: Rainfall Prediction Classifier 🌧️

---

## Project Overview

In this project, you will build a **Rainfall Prediction Classifier** using real-world data. This hands-on lab will guide you through **data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation** while providing a practical introduction to machine learning pipelines and cross-validation techniques.  

---

## Objectives 🎯

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explore and **perform feature engineering** on a real-world dataset  
- Build a **classifier pipeline** and optimize it using **Grid Search Cross-Validation**  
- **Evaluate model performance** with metrics and visualizations  
- Implement alternative classifiers by updating your pipeline  
- Use **parameter tuning** effectively for each classifier  

---

## Instructions 📝

1. Complete the Jupyter Notebook exercises provided.  
2. Download your notebook via **File > Download**.  
3. Submit your notebook for grading using the **AI grader** in the next section.  
4. Copy your Markdown responses into the **AI Mark assignment** for review.
